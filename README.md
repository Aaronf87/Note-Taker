## Note Taker ðŸ˜€

This is the note taker app using nodejs and expressjs framework.  This application was designed to add productivity to your daily life.



## How to Submit the Challenge
You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

The URL of the functional, deployed application.

The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.


## Getting Started
The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

The following HTML routes should be created:

GET /notes should return the notes.html file.

GET * should return the index.html file.

The following API routes should be created:

GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).
